    Changed how subtext is handled in bar view
    
    - Changed how subtext is handled in 'Bar View' by adding new subtext options, that are seperate from 'Headline View' options, to 'Bar View' instead of a checkbox.
    - Fixed an issue with Auras where it would sometimes show buffs one row higher than intended if there were not debuffs on the unit.

    Added subtext to bar view
    
    - Added subtext to bar view, this can be enabled through an option under 'Health Bar View'. (Still need to find a way to fix the offset on 'Auras' when the unit doesn't have a subtext)
